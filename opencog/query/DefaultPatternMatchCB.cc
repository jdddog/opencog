// Find a good place to start the search.
//
// The handle h points to a clause.  In principle, it is enough to
// simply find a constant in the clause, and just start there. In
// practice, this can be an awful way to do things. So, for example,
// most "typical" clauses will be of the form
//
//    EvaluationLink
//        PredicteNode "blah"
//        ListLink
//            VariableNode $var
//            ConceptNode  "item"
//
// Typically, the incoming set to "blah" will be huge, so starting the
// search there would be a poor choice. Typically, the incoming set to
// "item" will be much smaller, and so makes a better choice.  The code
// below tries to pass over "blah" and pick "item" instead.  It does so
// by comparing the size of the incoming sets of the two constants, and
// picking the one with the smaller ("thinner") incoming set. Note that
// this is a form of "greedy" search.
//
// Note that the algo performs a full-depth search to find this. That's
// OK, because typeical clauses are never deep.
//
// Note that the size of the incoming set really is a better measure,
// and not the depth.  So, for example, if "item" has a huge incoming
// set, but "blah" does not, then "blah" is a much better place to
// start.
//
// size_t& depth will be set to the depth of the thinnest constant found.
// Handle& start will be set to the link containing that constant.
// size_t& width will be set to the incoming-set size of the thinnest
//               constant found.
// The returned value will be the constant at which to start the search.
// If no constant is found, then the returned value is the undefnied
// handle.

/**
 * Search for solutions/groundings over all of the AtomSpace, using
 * some "reasonable" assumptions for what might be searched for. Or,
 * to put it bluntly, this search method *might* miss some possible
 * solutions, for certain "unusual" search types. The trade-off is
 * that this search algo should really be quite fast for "normal"
 * search types.
 *
 * This search algo makes the following (important) assumptions:
 *
 * 1) If there are no variables in the clauses, then this will search
 *    over all links which have the same type as the first clause.
 *    Clearly, this kind of search can fail if link_match() callback
 *    was prepared to accept other link types as well.
 *
 * 2) If there are variables, then the search will begin at the first
 *    non-variable node in the first clause.  The search will proceed
 *    by exploring the entire incoming-set for this node, but no farther.
 *    If the node_match() callback is willing to accept a broader range
 *    of node matches, esp for this initial node, then many possible
 *    solutions will be missed.
 *
 * 3) If the clauses consist entirely of variables, the same search
 *    as described in 1) will be performed.
 *
 * The above describes the limits to the "typical" search that this
 * algo can do well. In particular, if the constraint of 2) can be met,
 * then the search can be quite rapid, since incoming sets are often
 * quite small; and assumption 2) limits the search to "nearby",
 * connected atoms.
 *
 * Note that the default implementation of node_match() and link_match()
 * in this class does satisfy both 1) and 2), so this algo will work
 * correctly if these two methods are not overloaded.
 *
 * If you overload node_match(), and do so in a way that breaks
 * assumption 2), then you will scratch your head, thinking
 * "why did my search fail to find this obvious solution?" The answer
 * will be for you to create a new search algo, in a new class, that
 * overloads this one, and does what you want it to.  This class should
 * probably *not* be modified, since it is quite efficient for the
 * "normal" case.
